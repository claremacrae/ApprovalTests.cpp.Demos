# ApprovalTests.cpp Demo code

## Introduction

Code samples and information for various talks and demos on ApprovalTests.cpp.

The samples here demonstrate use of [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp), which is a new C++ implementation of Llewellyn Falco's [Approval Tests](http://approvaltests.com/) approach to testing legacy code.
